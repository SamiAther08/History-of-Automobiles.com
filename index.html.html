<p style="text-align:center;color:red;"><i><b>Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot</b>, a French military engineer who in <del>1760</del> 1769 built a steam-powered tricycle for hauling artillery.
 The vehicle’s single front wheel performed both steering and driving functions, and it could travel at 2.25 miles per hour with four passengers aboard for
 about 15 minutes. At that point Cugnot’s fardier à       vrapeuas it was known, would need to rest in order to recuperate enough power to move again.</i></p>

<h1 style="text-align:center;color:blue;">Hybrid Automobiles</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;color:red;"><i>Quite simply, a hybrid combines at least one electric motor with a gasoline engine to move the car, and its system recaptures energy
 via regenerative braking.Sometimes the electric motor does all the work, sometimes it's the gas engine, and sometimes they work together. 
The result is less gasoline burned and, therefore, better fuel economy. Adding electric power can even boost performance in certain instances.</i></p>
